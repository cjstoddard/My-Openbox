# My-Openbox

If you read my blog and decided that was too much work and you just want your machine to look and act like mine more of less, here is everything you need, plus a shell script to do everything for you.

If all you have is a basic install of Debian 12, you will need to install git and then retrive these files.

sudo apt install git

git clone https://github.com/cjstoddard/My-Openbox.git

cd My-Openbox

chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh

If all goes well, you should beable to reboot the system and have everything just work.
