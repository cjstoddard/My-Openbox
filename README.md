If you read my blog;

 and decided that was too much work and you just want your machine to look and act like mine more of less, here is everything you need, plus a shell script to do everything for you.

If all you have is a basic install of Debian 12, you will need to run the following commands.

    sudo apt install git

    git clone https://github.com/cjstoddard/My-Openbox.git

    cd My-Openbox

    chmod +x install.sh

    ./install.sh

If all goes well, you should bea ble to reboot the system and have everything just work.
